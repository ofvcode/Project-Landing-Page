# Project:  Landing Page

 This project is just to test out my skills building a business oriented website, I will be using HTML and CSS to represent my skills (not js yet)
 

<h3>Here is the goal of what i want to accomplish:</h2>
<div style="display: flex;">
 <img src="image2.png" style="height:500px; ">
 <img src="image1.png" style="height:500px; ">

 </div>
 <p>Here is a representation of what I will be making, the link below is going to show the website I built compared to the finished product that I was supposed to get in the image above.</p>
